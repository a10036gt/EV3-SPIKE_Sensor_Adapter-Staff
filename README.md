# EV3-SPIKE_Sensor_Adapter-Staff
This Block allows you to connect LEGO SPIKE Prime/Robot Inventor sensors to LEGO EV3 with adapter board.

## How it works
The EV3 using UART protocol to communicate with sensors, and SPIKE Prime/Robot Inventor(Powered Up devices) using same protocol with some new extensions. So that we can build a simple adapter to connect sensors and EV3.

## Hardware
All EV3/SPIKE/RI Sensors (except EV3 Touch) have small MCUs (STM8) running inside it, EV3 running with 5 V standard, SPIKE/RI running with 3.3 V standard, and MCU in sensors support 2.95 V to 5.5 V, and seems there is no LDO on sensor's PCB, Power is directly connect to MCU's VDD. So that we can build a simple adapter or jump wire to connect sensors and hub.

### SPIKE/RI Sensors Connect to EV3:
Due to EV3 using Auto-ID to identify sensors, Pin 1 need lower than 100 mV, so EV3 side Pin 1 need short to ground (Pin 3) (In EV3 sensors they do the same things), but some SPIKE/RI sensor's component (Color, Ultra Sonic LEDs) using Pin 1 to get more power, so that SPIKE/RI side Pin 1 need short to VCC (Pin 4). Other Pins just connect it from side to side. (Pin6<->Pin6, Pin5<->Pin5...).


### EV3 Sensors Connect to SPIKE/RI Hub:
Because EV3 Sensor can work with 3.3v, so just simply connect Pin 3, 4, 5, 6 (Pin 1 and 2 NC), than SPIKE/RI Hub can read value from EV3!

          EV3 Sensor Pins      <------> SPIKE/RI Hub Pins
    Pin 1 (WHITE, ADC 5V ref.)    NC    Pin 1 M1
    Pin 2 (BLACK, AutoID     )    NC    Pin 2 M2
    Pin 3 (RED, GND          ) <------> Pin 3 GND
    Pin 4 (GREEN, VIN        ) <------> Pin 4 3V3
    Pin 5 (YELLOW, Rx, SCL   ) <------> Pin 5 Tx
    Pin 6 (BLUE, Tx, SDA     ) <------> Pin 6 Rx

## Software

### EV3 with SPIKE Sensors:
The Sensor will send information to the brick, so EV3 will know sensor's id, name, mode, data type...etc., and we make some blocks for EV3-G so that user can easily use those block to reading value from sensors.

> It's not possible control the LEDs on SPIKE/RI Color and Ultra Sonic Sensor in EV3 Environment, Since it use write command with CMD_WRITE_DATA, this function is omitted on EV3. Unless rebuild the EV3 firmware.

### SPIKE/RI Hub with EV3 Sensors:
Using following code to get the info and data from EV3 sensors:
#### Print Sensor Info

	from hub import port 
    
    print(port.A.info())

#### Print Sensor Value
    from hub import port 
    
    Sensor = port.A.device 
    Sensor.mode(0)
    Val = Sensor.get()[0] 
    print(Val)
